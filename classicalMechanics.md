# notes
status : Most of the contents in this chapter was well understand except rotational motion, angular momentum and rigid body. 
## energy 
There are two types of energy constantly confuses me:
* Rotational kinetic energy:$\frac{1}{2}I\omega^2$
* Spring potential energy: $\frac{1}{2}k\omega^2$
